# Linux Shells

## Linux Shell Overview

- **Shell**: Interface between the user and the OS that interprets commands.
- **CLI vs GUI**:
    - *GUI* = visual and user-friendly, but less powerful.
    - *CLI* = command-based, faster, more efficient, and provides deeper control.
- **Example Analogy**: Using GUI is like ordering food; CLI is like cooking it yourself with shell guidance.

## Basic Shell Commands

| Command | Function |
| --- | --- |
| `pwd` | Displays current working directory |
| `cd` | Changes the directory |
| `ls` | Lists files and directories |
| `cat filename.txt` | Displays contents of a file |
| `grep <pattern> <file>` | Searches for text or patterns within files |

## Types of Linux Shells

- **Check Current Shell**: `echo $SHELL`
- **List Available Shells**: `cat /etc/shells`
- **Switch Shell**: Run shell name (e.g., `zsh`)
- **Change Default Shell**: `chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh`

| Feature | **Bash** | **Fish** | **Zsh** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Full Name | Bourne Again Shell | Friendly Interactive Shell | Z Shell |
| Scripting | Strong, widely compatible | Limited | Advanced & flexible |
| Tab Completion | Basic | Intelligent, context-aware | Plugin-extensible |
| Customization | Basic | Moderate | Advanced (via *oh-my-zsh*) |
| User Friendliness | Traditional, less friendly | Most user-friendly | User-friendly when customized |
| Syntax Highlighting | None | Built-in | Plugin-supported |

**Notes:**

- **Bash**: Default in most Linux distros; supports history, tab completion.
- **Fish**: Beginner-friendly, auto spell-correction, syntax highlighting.
- **Zsh**: Combines features of Bash & Fish; highly customizable.

## Shell Scripting Basics

**Purpose:** Automate repetitive tasks by executing multiple commands sequentially.

**Steps to Create and Run a Script:**

1. Create a file with `.sh` extension — `nano script.sh`
2. Start with a **shebang** (`#!/bin/bash`) to specify the interpreter.
3. Write commands.
4. Give execute permission — `chmod +x script.sh`
5. Run using — `./script.sh`

## Core Scripting Components

### Variables

- Store data to reuse in scripts.
    
    ```bash
    read name
    echo "Welcome, $name"
    ```
    
- Use `$` to reference variable values.

### Loops

- Repeat a block of code for a sequence.
    
    ```bash
    for i in {1..10}; do
        echo $i
    done
    ```
    
- Useful for automation and repetitive operations.

### Conditional Statements

- Execute commands based on specific conditions.
    
    ```bash
    if [ "$name" = "Stewart" ]; then
        echo "Welcome Stewart!"
    else
        echo "Access Denied"
    fi
    ```
    

### Comments

- Lines starting with `#` are ignored by the shell; used for code explanation.
    
    ```bash
    # This is a comment
    ```
