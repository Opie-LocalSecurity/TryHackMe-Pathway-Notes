# Search Skills

## Evaluating Online Information

When reviewing online content (blogs, wikis, articles, etc.), assess its **credibility** using four key criteria:

- **Source:** Identify the author/organization and their authority on the topic.
- **Evidence & Reasoning:** Look for factual data and logical arguments.
- **Objectivity & Bias:** Avoid content with hidden agendas or emotional appeals.
- **Corroboration:** Verify claims via multiple reputable sources for consistency.

## Search Engines & Advanced Search Techniques

Maximize search effectiveness using **advanced operators**:

| Operator | Function | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `"exact phrase"` | Finds exact wording | `"passive reconnaissance"` |
| `site:` | Limits search to a specific domain | `site:tryhackme.com success stories` |
| `-` | Excludes terms from results | `pyramids -tourism` |
| `filetype:` | Searches for specific file formats (PDF, DOC, PPT, etc.) | `filetype:ppt cyber security` |

## Specialized Search Engines

Used for **targeted or technical information**:

- **Shodan:**
    - Searches Internet-connected devices (servers, IoT, ICS).
    - Example: `apache 2.4.1` → servers running that version.
    - Useful for assessing exposed systems.
    - 🔗 [Shodan.io](https://www.shodan.io/)
- **Censys:**
    - Focuses on Internet assets (hosts, domains, certificates).
    - Used for auditing ports/services and discovering rogue assets.
    - 🔗 [Censys.io](https://search.censys.io/)
- **VirusTotal:**
    - Multi-engine malware scanner for files, URLs, and hashes.
    - Displays results from ~67 antivirus engines + community feedback.
    - 🔗 [VirusTotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com/)
- **Have I Been Pwned (HIBP):**
    - Checks if emails appear in known data breaches.
    - Helps assess password reuse risks.

## Vulnerabilities & Exploits

- **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures):**
    - Standardized ID system for vulnerabilities (e.g., `CVE-2024-29988`).
    - Maintained by **MITRE**; searchable on [CVE.org](https://www.cve.org/) or [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/).
- **Exploit Database:**
    - Repository of verified exploit code for testing authorized systems.
    - 🔗 [Exploit-DB.com](https://www.exploit-db.com/)
- **GitHub:**
    - Contains PoC (proof-of-concept) exploits and CVE-related tools.
    - Example: Search for “Heartbleed” to find associated repositories.

## Technical Documentation

Official documentation is the **most accurate and up-to-date** reference source.

- **Linux Manual Pages (`man`):**
    - Built-in command help system (e.g., `man ip`).
    - Accessible online (e.g., [man ip](https://linux.die.net/man/8/ip)).
- **Microsoft Documentation:**
    - Covers all Windows tools and commands.
    - 🔗 [learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/)
- **Product Documentation:**
    - Authoritative info for specific software or systems:
        - [Snort Docs](https://www.snort.org/documents)
        - [Apache HTTP Docs](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/)
        - [PHP Manual](https://www.php.net/manual/en/index.php)
        - [Node.js Docs](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/)

## Social Media & Cybersecurity Awareness

- **Purpose:**
    - Follow companies and professionals to stay updated on trends and threats.
    - Use temporary emails when exploring new platforms for privacy.
- **Security Implications:**
    - Oversharing (e.g., personal info) can aid attackers in password recovery.
    - Monitor employee exposure to prevent social engineering risks.
- **Information Sources:**
    - Platforms: Facebook, Twitter (X), LinkedIn, etc.
    - Supplement knowledge with cyber-security-focused news outlets.
