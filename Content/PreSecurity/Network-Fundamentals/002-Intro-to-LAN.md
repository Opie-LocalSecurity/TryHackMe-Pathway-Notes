# Intro to LAN

## LAN Topologies Overview

A **topology** defines the design or structure of a network — how devices connect and communicate. Common LAN topologies include **Star**, **Bus**, and **Ring**.

### Star Topology

- **Structure:** Devices connect individually to a **central hub or switch**.
- **Advantages:**
    - Highly **reliable** — one cable/device failure doesn’t impact others.
    - Easily **scalable** — simple to add more devices.
- **Disadvantages:**
    - **Costly** due to extra cabling and networking hardware.
    - **Central point of failure** — if the hub/switch fails, communication stops.
    - Requires **maintenance** as the network grows.

### Bus Topology

- **Structure:** All devices share a **single backbone cable** (like a branch with leaves).
- **Advantages:**
    - **Low cost** — minimal cabling and equipment.
    - **Simple** setup for small networks.
- **Disadvantages:**
    - **Bottlenecks** — all data shares one path, slowing performance.
    - **Difficult troubleshooting** — hard to isolate faults.
    - **Single point of failure** — if the backbone cable breaks, the network goes down.
    - **Limited scalability** and redundancy.

### Ring Topology

- **Structure:** Devices connect in a **loop**, each forwarding data in one direction.
- **Advantages:**
    - **Less cabling** than star topology.
    - **Easy fault identification** due to the single data path.
    - **Less congestion** — controlled data transmission (token passing).
- **Disadvantages:**
    - **Inefficient routing** — data may traverse many devices.
    - **Network-wide failure** if one device/cable breaks (no redundancy).

## Core Networking Devices

### Switch

- **Purpose:** Connects multiple devices (computers, printers, etc.) within a LAN.
- **Functionality:**
    - Uses **MAC address tables** to send packets only to the intended recipient.
    - More **efficient** than hubs (which broadcast data to all ports).
- **Ports:** Vary (4–64+). Found in larger networks (schools, offices).
- **Redundancy:** Multiple switches/routers can interconnect to improve reliability.

### Router

- **Purpose:** Connects **different networks** and directs data between them.
- **Uses Routing:** Determines the best **path for data** to travel between networks.
- **Example:** Routes data between a local network and the internet.

## Subnetting

- **Definition:** Dividing a network into smaller **sub-networks (subnets)** for better management and security.
- **Purpose:**
    - Organizes devices (e.g., departments like HR or Finance).
    - Improves **efficiency, control, and security**.
- **Subnet Mask:** Defines how IP addresses are split between **network** and **host** portions.
    - Example: `192.168.1.0` network, `192.168.1.100` host, `192.168.1.254` gateway.
- **Benefits:**
    - Separates network traffic (e.g., employee vs. public Wi-Fi in a café).
    - Reduces congestion and improves security.

## Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

- **Purpose:** Maps **IP addresses** to **MAC addresses** within a local network.
- **Process:**
    1. **ARP Request:** Broadcast — “Who owns this IP address?”
    2. **ARP Reply:** Target device responds with its MAC address.
- **Storage:** Each device keeps a local **ARP cache** for faster communication.
- **Function:** Enables devices to find physical (MAC) addresses for IP-level communication.

## Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

- **Purpose:** **Automatically assigns IP addresses** to devices on a network.
- **Process (DORA):**
    1. **Discover:** Device asks if a DHCP server is available.
    2. **Offer:** Server proposes an IP address.
    3. **Request:** Device requests that offered IP.
    4. **Acknowledge (ACK):** Server confirms and assigns the IP.
- **Benefit:** Eliminates need for manual IP configuration; reduces address conflicts.
