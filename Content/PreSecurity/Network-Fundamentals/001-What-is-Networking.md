# What is Networking?

## Understanding Networks

- **Definition:** A network is a group of connected entities that share information or resources.
- **Examples:**
    - Social: friends with shared interests
    - Infrastructure: power grids, transport systems, postal systems
    - Computing: connected devices like phones, laptops, servers, IoT systems
- **Importance:** Networks underpin everyday technology and are fundamental to **cybersecurity**, communication, and data sharing.

## The Internet

- **Definition:** A massive global network of interconnected smaller networks (private + public).
- **Analogy:** Like friends-of-friends connected through intermediaries who can “translate” between groups.
- **History:**
    - **1960s:** ARPANET — first functional computer network, funded by the U.S. DoD.
    - **1989:** Tim Berners-Lee creates the **World Wide Web (WWW)** — transforms the Internet into a global information system.
- **Types of Networks:**
    - **Private Network:** Internal, local connections (e.g., home Wi-Fi).
    - **Public Network:** Connects private networks together — the Internet.

## Identifying Devices on a Network

Each device has **two identifiers**, similar to a person’s name and fingerprints:

### IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)

- Identifies a device **temporarily** on a network.
- Written as four **octets** (e.g., `192.168.1.74`).
- **Can change** and may be reassigned.

**Types:**

- **Private IP:** Used within local/private networks.
- **Public IP:** Used on the Internet; assigned by an **ISP**.
    - Multiple devices in a home share one public IP but have unique private IPs.

**IP Versions:**

- **IPv4:** 32-bit (≈ 4.3 billion addresses); shortage of available addresses.
- **IPv6:** 128-bit (≈ 340 trillion+ addresses); solves IPv4 exhaustion and improves efficiency.

### MAC Address (Media Access Control Address)

- **Permanent hardware identifier** burned into a device’s network interface card (NIC).
- **Format:** 12 hexadecimal digits (e.g., `a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2d`).
    - First 6 = manufacturer, last 6 = unique serial.
- **Immutable** (but can be **spoofed**).

**MAC Spoofing:**

- Changing a device’s MAC to impersonate another.
- Can bypass poorly designed security (e.g., firewalls or Wi-Fi access controls that trust specific MACs).
- Common in public Wi-Fi systems (e.g., cafes, hotels).

## PING and ICMP

- **PING:** A basic diagnostic tool to test network connectivity.
- **Protocol Used:** **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**.
- **How it Works:**
    - Sends an **echo request** to a target IP.
    - Receives an **echo reply** if the target is reachable.
    - Measures **latency** (round-trip time).

**Example Command:**
- Reports packets sent/received and average response time (e.g., 4.16 ms).
- Useful for testing connectivity and troubleshooting networks.
