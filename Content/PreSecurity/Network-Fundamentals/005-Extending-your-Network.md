# Extending your Network

## Port Forwarding

- **Purpose:** Makes internal network services (e.g., web servers) accessible from the Internet.
- **How it works:**
    - Configured on a router to forward incoming traffic from a specific public port to a private IP and port on the local network.
    - Example: Public IP `82.62.51.70` forwards traffic on port 80 to internal server `192.168.1.10:80`.
- **Comparison with Firewalls:**
    - **Port forwarding:** Opens a specific port for access.
    - **Firewall:** Controls whether traffic is allowed through that port.

## Firewalls

- **Function:** Control inbound and outbound traffic based on rules. Acts as “border security” for networks.
- **Rule Criteria:**
    - Source/destination address
    - Port number
    - Protocol type (TCP, UDP, etc.)
- **Types:**
    
    
    | Type | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Stateful Firewall** | Analyzes the **entire connection** (dynamic). Uses more resources. Blocks based on connection behavior. |
    | **Stateless Firewall** | Analyzes **individual packets** (static rules). Uses fewer resources but is less intelligent. Useful for filtering large traffic volumes like DDoS attacks. |
- **Examples:** Hardware firewalls (enterprise routers), software-based firewalls (e.g., Snort).

## VPN (Virtual Private Network)

- **Purpose:** Securely connects devices or networks over the Internet using an **encrypted tunnel**.
- **Functionality:** Creates a private network between remote devices or offices (e.g., Office #1 ↔ Office #2).
- **Key Benefits:**
    
    
    | Benefit | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Remote connectivity** | Connects geographically separate offices or networks. |
    | **Privacy** | Encrypts traffic to prevent eavesdropping on public Wi-Fi. |
    | **Anonymity** | Hides user identity from ISPs and intermediaries (depending on VPN provider practices). |
- **Use Case (TryHackMe):** Safely connect users to vulnerable machines without public Internet exposure.
- **Common VPN Technologies:**
    
    
    | Technology | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | **PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)** | Handles authentication and encryption; not routable by itself. |
    | **PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol)** | Uses PPP data for tunneling; easy setup but weak encryption. |
    | **IPSec (Internet Protocol Security)** | Encrypts IP packets directly; strong encryption but complex setup. |

## LAN Networking Devices

### Routers

- **Function:** Connect different networks and determine the best path for data (Layer 3 of OSI).
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Route packets based on factors like shortest, fastest, or most reliable path.
    - Support configurations such as port forwarding and firewall rules.
- **Key Role:** Directs traffic between networks (e.g., local and Internet).

### OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
- Key Characteristics:
    - Type: Link-State routing protocol.
    - Metric: Cost, which is calculated based on link bandwidth (default formula: $10^8 / \text{Bandwidth in bps}$).
    - Algorithm: Uses Dijkstra's Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm to construct a topological map of the entire network.
    - Update Mechanism: Routers send Link State Advertisements (LSAs) only when a network change occurs, and every 30 minutes to ensure database synchronization.
- Advantages:
    - Scalability: Highly scalable and suited for large, complex networks because it supports hierarchical design (Areas).
    - Convergence: Very fast convergence due to event-triggered updates, allowing quick adaptation to network changes.
    - Loop-Free: The SPF algorithm guarantees a loop-free routing topology.
    - Intelligent Path: Chooses the best path based on bandwidth, providing more efficient traffic distribution.
- Disavantages:
    - Complexity: More complex to configure and troubleshoot than RIP.
    - Overhead: Requires more CPU and memory resources from the routers to run the SPF algorithm and maintain the link-state database.

### RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
- Key Characteristics:
    - Type: Distance-Vector routing protocol.
    - Metric: Hop Count (number of routers traversed).
    - Algorithm: Uses the Bellman-Ford algorithm (or a variation).
    - Update Mechanism: Routers send their entire routing table to their immediate neighbors every 30 seconds, regardless of whether the network has changed.
- Advantages:
    - Simplicity: Very easy to configure and implement, making it suitable for small environments.
    - Low Overhead (Initial): Requires less initial processing power compared to OSPF's database creation.
- Disavantages:
    - Scalability Limit: Has a maximum hop count of 15 (a path of 16 hops is considered unreachable), severely limiting network size.
    - Convergence: Slow convergence due to periodic updates and reliance on timers (e.g., hold-down timers) to resolve network issues.
    - Less Efficient Path: Only considers the number of hops, potentially choosing a slower path over a fast, high-bandwidth path that has one more hop.
    - Bandwidth Use: Periodic broadcasts of the entire routing table can consume unnecessary network bandwidth, even when the network is stable.

### Switches

- **Function:** Connect multiple devices within the same network.
- **Types:**
    
    
    | Type | OSI Layer | Function |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Layer 2 Switch** | Layer 2 | Forwards **frames** using **MAC addresses**. |
    | **Layer 3 Switch** | Layer 3 | Forwards **frames** and also **routes packets** using **IP addresses** (partial router functionality). |
- **VLAN (Virtual LAN):**
    - Splits a physical network into logical segments for **security** and **traffic management**.
    - Example: “Sales” and “Accounting” departments share the same switch but cannot communicate directly while both access the Internet.
