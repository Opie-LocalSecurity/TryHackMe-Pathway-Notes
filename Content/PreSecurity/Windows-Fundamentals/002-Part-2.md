# Part 2

## System Configuration (MSConfig)

- Used for **advanced troubleshooting** and diagnosing **startup issues**.
- Requires **administrator rights** to open.
- **Tabs:**
    - **General:** Choose startup mode — *Normal*, *Diagnostic*, or *Selective*.
    - **Boot:** Configure OS boot options.
    - **Services:** View/manage all system services (running or stopped).
    - **Startup:** Redirects to **Task Manager** for managing startup programs.
    - **Tools:** Quick access to Windows management tools; each tool shows its launch command.

## User Account Control (UAC)

- Adjusted via the **System Configuration → Tools** tab.
- Controls when users are notified about system changes.
- Slider modifies UAC strictness; disabling it entirely is **not recommended**.

## Computer Management (`compmgmt.msc`)

Organized into three main sections:

1. **System Tools**
    - **Task Scheduler:** Automate tasks (apps/scripts) by event or time.
    - **Event Viewer:** Logs system/application/security events for auditing and troubleshooting.
        - Event types: *Error, Warning, Information, Success Audit, Failure Audit*.
        - Standard logs: *Application, Security, Setup, System, Forwarded Events*.
    - **Shared Folders:** View shared resources, connected users, and open files.
    - **Local Users and Groups (`lusrmgr.msc`):** Manage user accounts and groups.
    - **Performance Monitor (`perfmon`):** Analyze system performance in real time or via logs.
    - **Device Manager:** Manage hardware devices (enable, disable, update drivers).
2. **Storage**
    - **Disk Management:** Perform disk/partition tasks (create, extend, shrink, assign drive letters).
3. **Services and Applications**
    - **Services:** Start/stop and configure Windows background services.
    - **WMI Control:** Manage **Windows Management Instrumentation**, used by scripts and PowerShell for system administration.
        - **WMIC** is deprecated; **PowerShell** replaces it.

## System Information (`msinfo32`)

- Displays **comprehensive system data** for diagnostics.
- Sections:
    - **Hardware Resources:** Technical hardware details (IRQ, memory, etc.).
    - **Components:** Hardware info (e.g., display, input devices).
    - **Software Environment:** Lists installed software, environment variables, and network info.
- Includes **search bar** for quick queries (e.g., “IP address”).
- **Environment Variables:** Store OS and program configuration paths and settings.

## Resource Monitor (`resmon`)

- Provides **detailed resource usage** by process:
    - Tabs: **CPU**, **Disk**, **Network**, **Memory**.
- Useful for diagnosing system performance issues and identifying unresponsive or resource-heavy processes.
- Supports process filtering and conflict detection (e.g., file locks).

## Registry Editor (`regedit`)

- Central hierarchical database that stores configuration for users, hardware, and software.
- Key contents include:
    - User profiles
    - Installed applications
    - System hardware and ports
- **Advanced tool** — improper edits can destabilize the system.
- Used to **view/edit registry keys** directly.
