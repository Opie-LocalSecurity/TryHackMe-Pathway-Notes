## 🛡️ Virus & Threat Protection

### Current Threats

- **Scan Options:**
    - *Quick scan:* Scans common malware locations.
    - *Full scan:* Scans all files and running programs (time-consuming).
    - *Custom scan:* User selects specific files/folders.
- **Threat History:**
    - *Last scan:* Logs the most recent automatic or manual scan.
    - *Quarantined threats:* Isolated items prevented from running.
    - *Allowed threats:* Manually permitted items (risky—only if certain).

> ⚠️ Only allow flagged items if you are 100% sure they are safe.
> 

### Virus & Threat Protection Settings

- **Manage Settings:**
    - *Real-time protection:* Prevents malware from installing or running.
    - *Cloud-delivered protection:* Uses Microsoft’s cloud intelligence for faster updates.
    - *Automatic sample submission:* Sends suspicious files to Microsoft.
    - *Controlled folder access:* Blocks unauthorized changes to files/folders.
    - *Exclusions:* Files/folders excluded from scans (use cautiously).
    - *Notifications:* Alerts about device security.
- **Updates:** Manual definition updates for Windows Defender.
- **Ransomware Protection:** Requires *Controlled folder access* and *Real-time protection* enabled.

> ⚠️ Keep Real-time protection ON unless using trusted third-party antivirus.
> 

**Tip:** Right-click any file/folder → *Scan with Microsoft Defender*.

## 🔥 Firewall & Network Protection

### Firewall Profiles

- **Domain:** Used on domain-controlled networks.
- **Private:** For trusted networks (home/work).
- **Public:** Default; for untrusted/public networks (e.g., Wi-Fi hotspots).

Each profile allows toggling:

- *Firewall on/off*
- *Block all incoming connections*

> ⚠️ Leave the firewall enabled unless absolutely sure of your configuration.
> 

### Allow an App Through Firewall

- Manage which apps can communicate on *Private* or *Public* networks.

### Advanced Settings

- For expert configuration (`WF.msc` command).
- Refer to [Microsoft Firewall Best Practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/best-practices-configuring).

## 🌐 Apps & Browser Control

### SmartScreen

- Protects from phishing/malware sites and suspicious downloads.
- *Check apps and files:* Blocks or warns about unrecognized executables.

### Exploit Protection

- Built-in mitigation against common exploit techniques.
- Leave defaults enabled for maximum protection.

## 💻 Device Security

### Core Isolation

- *Memory Integrity:* Prevents malicious code injection into secure processes.

> ⚠️ Recommended to leave default settings.
> 

### Security Processor (TPM)

- *Trusted Platform Module (TPM):* Hardware chip performing cryptographic operations.
    - Protects against tampering.
    - Used for secure key storage and system integrity checks.

## 🔐 BitLocker

- **Purpose:** Encrypts drives to prevent data theft/loss on lost or stolen devices.
- **Best with TPM (v1.2+):** Ensures system integrity and protects encryption keys.
- Integrates with Windows OS for seamless protection.

> See Microsoft’s BitLocker Overview.
> 

## 🗂️ Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS)

- **Function:** Creates consistent snapshots (“restore points”) for backup and recovery.
- **Stored in:** `System Volume Information` on each protected drive.
- **Tasks:**
    - Create/restore system points
    - Configure or delete restore points

> ⚠️ Malware may delete shadow copies to block recovery after ransomware attacks.
> 
> 
> Keep **offline/off-site backups** for reliable recovery.
