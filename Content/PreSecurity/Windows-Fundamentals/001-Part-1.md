## 🧩 File Systems in Windows

### NTFS (New Technology File System)

- Default file system in modern Windows.
- **Predecessors:** FAT16, FAT32, HPFS
- **Still used:** FAT (in USB drives, SD cards, etc.)
- **Key Advantages of NTFS:**
    - Journaling for automatic recovery after failures
    - Supports files > 4 GB
    - File/folder permissions
    - Compression and encryption (EFS – Encrypting File System)

### NTFS Permissions

- Permission types: **Full Control, Modify, Read & Execute, List Folder Contents, Read, Write**
- View via: *Right-click → Properties → Security tab*
- Permissions can be applied per user/group.

### Alternate Data Streams (ADS)

- Feature allowing multiple data streams per file (e.g., `file.txt::$DATA`)
- Hidden from File Explorer; viewable via PowerShell or tools.
- Used both legitimately (metadata, downloaded file source tags) and maliciously (hiding malware).

## 🗂️ **Windows and System32 Folders**

- **C:\Windows** — contains the operating system.
    - Location can vary; identified via environment variable `%windir%`.
    - Example: `%windir%\System32`
- **System32 Folder:** contains critical system executables and libraries.
    - Deleting/modifying files can break Windows.
    - Many administrative tools are stored here.

**Environment Variables**

- Store OS information (e.g., `%windir%`, `%temp%`, `%path%`).
- Accessible via PowerShell or system settings.

## 👤 **User Accounts, Profiles, and Permissions**

### User Types

- **Administrator:** Full system control (add/remove users, install software, modify settings).
- **Standard User:** Limited to personal files and non-system tasks.

### User Profiles

- Created on first login; stored in `C:\Users\<Username>`
- Includes default folders: Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Music, Pictures.

### User Management

- Managed via:
    - `Settings → Accounts → Other users`
    - `Run → lusrmgr.msc` (Local Users and Groups)
- Users belong to **groups**, inheriting group permissions.
- Only administrators can add/remove users or change account types.

## 🛡️ **User Account Control (UAC)**

**Purpose:** Prevent unauthorized system changes by elevating privileges only when needed.

- Introduced in **Windows Vista**; continues in all later versions.
- **How it works:**
    - Even administrator accounts run with standard privileges by default.
    - When elevated privileges are required, UAC prompts for confirmation or admin password.
    - The **shield icon** on programs indicates that elevation is needed.
- **Built-in Administrator account** bypasses UAC by default.
- **Security impact:** Reduces risk of malware executing with admin privileges.
