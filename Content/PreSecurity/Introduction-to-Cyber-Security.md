- Develop security strategies based on research into attack trends and tools.

## **Security Engineer**

**Focus:** Designing and implementing security solutions to prevent attacks.

**Key Tasks:**

- Test, monitor, and enhance software and network security systems.
- Identify vulnerabilities and deploy mitigation solutions.
- Maintain and upgrade defences to address evolving threats.

## **Incident Responder**

**Focus:** Managing and mitigating security breaches in real time.

**Key Tasks:**

- Develop and execute incident response plans and policies.
- Coordinate responses to active threats; measure efficiency via **MTTD**, **MTTA**, and **MTTR**.
